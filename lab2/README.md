# Lab 2 — Microservices Edge Case Testing
### ITSAR2 313 – System Architecture and Integration 2
### BIST 3B

> The three microservices tested in this lab are the same
> services built in Lab 1. Source code lives in:
> lab1/microservices/

cd lab2/tests
bash run-tests.sh
```

Evidence output saved to: lab2/docs/evidence/

## Deliverables

| Item | Location |
|------|----------|
| Source code | lab2/services/ |
| curl test commands | lab2/tests/curl-tests.md |
| Edge case report | lab2/docs/report.md |
| Formal report | lab2/docs/lab2-report.docx |
| Evidence files | lab2/docs/evidence/ |

## Requirements

PHP 8.2+, Composer, curl, bash

> Note: The academe frontend (lab1/academe/) is NOT
