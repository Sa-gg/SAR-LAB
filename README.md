## Project Description

Academe is a student–course enrollment system built twice:

1. **Monolithic** (`academe/`) — a single Laravel 10 application using the MVCR (Model–View–Controller–Repository) pattern.
2. **Microservices** (`microservices/`) — three independent Laravel services communicating over HTTP.

An environment variable toggle (`APP_BACKEND`) lets the monolithic app switch between its local database and the remote microservices at runtime.

## JSON Response Format

All microservice endpoints follow the same JSON structure:

**Success:**
```json
{
  "data": { ... },
  "message": "success" | "created" | "updated" | "deleted"
}
```

**Error:**
```json
{
  "error": "ERROR_CODE",
  "message": "Human-readable description"
}
```

### Error Codes

| Code | HTTP | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | 400 | Missing or invalid request fields |
| `NOT_FOUND` | 404 | Resource does not exist |
| `STUDENT_NOT_FOUND` | 404 | Referenced student does not exist (cross-service) |
| `COURSE_NOT_FOUND` | 404 | Referenced course does not exist (cross-service) |
| `DUPLICATE_EMAIL` | 409 | Email already registered |
| `DUPLICATE_ENROLLMENT` | 409 | Student already enrolled in course |
| `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` | 503 | Dependency service is not responding |
| `GATEWAY_TIMEOUT` | 504 | Dependency service took too long (>5s) |

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.1+
- Composer
- SQLite

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd academe && composer install
cd ../microservices/student-service && composer install
cd ../course-service && composer install
cd ../enrollment-service && composer install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Each service ships with a `.env.example`. Copy it to `.env` and generate an app key:

```bash
# Monolithic app
cd academe
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

# Student Service
cd ../microservices/student-service
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

# Course Service
cd ../course-service
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

# Enrollment Service
cd ../enrollment-service
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

All services are pre-configured for SQLite with no extra database setup required.

To start in monolithic mode (default), `academe/.env` already has `APP_BACKEND=monolithic`.
To switch to microservices mode after starting all four servers, change it to `APP_BACKEND=microservices`.

### 3. Create Databases and Seed

```bash
# For each service directory:
php artisan migrate --seed
```

### 4. Start Servers

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Monolithic app
cd academe
php artisan serve --port=8000

# Terminal 2 — Student Service
cd microservices/student-service
php artisan serve --port=8001

# Terminal 3 — Course Service
cd microservices/course-service
php artisan serve --port=8002

# Terminal 4 — Enrollment Service
cd microservices/enrollment-service
php artisan serve --port=8003
```

### 5. Toggle Backend Mode

Edit `academe/.env` and set `APP_BACKEND`:

```dotenv
APP_BACKEND=monolithic       # Uses local SQLite database
APP_BACKEND=microservices    # Proxies to student/course/enrollment services
```

Then clear the config cache:

```bash
cd academe
php artisan config:clear
```

### 6. Run Tests

See [tests/curl-tests.md](tests/curl-tests.md) for the full test suite.
